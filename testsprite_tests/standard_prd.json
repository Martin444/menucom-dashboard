  "product_overview": "MenuCom Dashboard Web Application is a Flutter-based web platform providing authenticated users with a comprehensive management interface featuring a scalable navigational menu and secure social login capabilities. It leverages Firebase Authentication, REST APIs, and GetX for efficient state and navigation management.",
  "core_goals": [
    "Enable seamless and secure user authentication including Google social login leveraging Firebase and backend token validation.",
    "Provide a robust, scalable, and maintainable sidebar navigation system with clear visual feedback and role-based access control.",
    "Implement smooth user experience with responsive, accessible UI components following Material Design principles.",
    "Ensure clean architecture and separation of concerns to facilitate maintainability and future expansion.",
    "Provide robust error handling and logging for effective debugging and user feedback."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "Google Sign-In social authentication fully integrated with Firebase and backend JWT token issuance via SocialLoginUseCase.",
    "Responsive and Material3-styled Google Sign-In button component with comprehensive state management (loading, success, error).",
    "Comprehensive integration and configuration for web platform including environment variables and Firebase SDK setup.",
    "Centralized and extensible sidebar menu navigation system with role-based item filtering, automatic route detection, and enhanced visual states including badges and animations.",
    "Improved user avatar display with role and business type formatting in the sidebar.",
    "Robust error handling and feedback mechanisms for authentication flows with snackbar notifications for users.",
    "Clean architecture separation using GetX for state and navigation control, bindings for dependency injection, and REST API integration for backend communication.",
    "Testing strategies and debugging support with detailed logging for authentication and navigation components."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "User lands on login page and uses Google Sign-In button to initiate social login.",
    "Upon Google authentication, Firebase user token is retrieved and used to request a JWT token from backend via SocialLoginUseCase.",
    "On successful authentication, user receives access token stored securely and is redirected to the dashboard.",
    "The sidebar navigation loads menu items filtered according to the user’s assigned role and permissions.",
    "User selects menu items which trigger navigation to appropriate routes with visual selection indicators and smooth animations.",
    "User can trigger logout or access profile and other management sections as permitted.",
    "Error states during login or navigation show contextual snackbars or dialogs with user-friendly messages.",
    "The system logs key events and errors to assist in debugging and monitoring.",
    "Future features like badges for notifications and dynamic menu groupings can easily be integrated due to the scalable design."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "All social login flows work successfully on supported web browsers without error, including proper handling of cancellations and errors.",
    "JWT token is correctly received from backend and used for authenticated requests in the session.",
    "Sidebar navigation displays appropriate menu items based on user role and permissions consistently.",
    "Navigation correctly updates selection states according to current route and provides smooth visual transitions.",
    "Google Sign-In button passes all usability and visual design requirements including Material3 compliance and responsive layout.",
    "Error feedback is consistent and informative for users, with snackbar messages for failures in login and backend validation.",
    "Codebase is free from compilation errors and passes existing automated tests relevant to authentication and navigation.",
    "Logging is enabled and captures relevant lifecycle and error information during login and navigation processes.",
    "Environment configurations and secrets (e.g., client IDs) are correctly loaded and used in app initialization.",
    "Future scalability and maintainability requirements are met, demonstrated by ease of adding new menu items or social login providers."
